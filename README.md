### A-Mail 

**A full stack, modern, AI mailbox deployed fully on AWS for firms handling heavy client communication.**
Originally prototyped for my current firm, I reimagined this AI infused mailbox to handle all client-side communication (direct emails, website form submissions, client portal enquiries) with sleek and secure AI integration and fully deployed on AWS. This system has reduced time spent on client interaction by nearly 70%. Try it yourself at [www.A-Mail.live](https://www.a-mail.live)

### Artisty 
**Reimagining E-shopping experience with AI Agents powered by LangChain, deployed on AWS.**
Artisty is a full-stack AI-Agent platform hosted on AWS that reimagines how people explore and purchase art. Instead of clunky filters or endless scrolling, Artisty deploys intelligent agents that act like a personal curator. These agents understand natural conversation, interpret intent, and take real actions in real time â€” from searching inventory and navigating the gallery to opening quick-views, managing your cart, and guiding checkout.
